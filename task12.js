//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of
//just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
//The text of each message should be the same, but each message should
//be personalized with the person’s name.

let arr = ["HUZAIFA", "SYED", "ALI", "KHOLI", '"QEA ALTAF HUSSAIN"'];
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log("How are you my friend", ",", arr[i]);
}
